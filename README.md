# Co-producing adaptation options to address future cross-border climate impacts

Sara Talebian, Henrik Carlsen, Oliver Johnson, Jan Volkholz, Elvine Kwamboka and Jonas Parnow

In this case study, we develop and use a set of stakeholder-driven sub-global scenarios linked to the global climate scenario architecture, especially the Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) to explore future cross-border climate impacts and adaptation options in Kenya. Co-production techniques are used throughout the process for developing scenarios and using them for impact assessment and adaptation planning.
