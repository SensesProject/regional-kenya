        <p>Participants were invited to co-produce adaptation options to address future cross-border climate impacts through a participatory <a href="https://climatescenarios.org/finder/techniques/?name=brainstorming" target="_blank">brainstorming</a> session. The process of generating adaptation options was focused on the present time and near future. Adaptation options were defined as stand-alone activities and action items that together could form adaptation pathways. However, developing pathways would require an additional step where a timeline is introduced to the process and adaptation options are given a time label. In this case study, we stopped the co-production process at the stage of identifying adaptation options and did not develop adaptation pathways. An example of using co-production techniques to build adaptation pathways is shown in <a href="https://climatescenarios.org/dutch" target="_blank">the Dutch case study</a>.</p>
        <p>After synthesizing the generated adaptation options, we identified the main themes of adaptation activities that were echoed along the four risk pathways and across the extended SSPs. We clustered these adaptation options into three key areas of adaptation and recommended those to policy makers for improving Kenya‚Äôs adaptation planning at present and near future in order to increase capacity to adapt to cross-border climate impacts in 2040-2060-time horizon.</p>
