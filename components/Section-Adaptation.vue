        <h2>Adaptation options</h2>
      </header>
      <p>In the next step, participants were invited to co-produce adaptation options to address future cross-border climate impacts through a participatory brainstorming [hyperlink to the co-production techniques DB] session. The process of generating adaptation options was focused on the present time and near future. </p>
      <p>After synthesizing the generated adaptation options, we identified the main themes of adaptation options and activities that were echoed along the four risk pathways and across several extended SSPs. We clustered these adaptation options into three key areas of adaptation and recommended those to policy makers to national and local adaptation planners and policy makers for improving Kenya‚Äôs adaptation planning at present and near future in order to increase capacity to mitigate/adapt to cross-border climate impacts in 2040-2060-time horizon. </p>

              <li>A big number of adaptation options identified were transnational (regional, international) adaptation activities suggesting that despite the historical trends, stakeholders believe that in order to be effective, adaptation is a collaborative progress being made through transnational governance and transboundary progress.</li>
              <li>Transnational and inter-governmental co-management of shared natural resources (i.e. transboundary water and shared ecosystems) were considered effective adaptation option to prepare the country to resolve future regional conflicts and transboundary water disputes.</li>
              <li>Transnational policy frameworks and legal programs for adaptation could assist Kenya and neighbouring countries to tackle common cross-border climate change impacts in a collective effort.</li>

              <li>When co-producing adaptation options, stakeholders emphasized that investing in research on cross-border climate impacts is necessary to prepare adaptation planning in Kenya to address future impacts transmitting across borders.</li>
              <li>Several adaptation options encompassed urgent needs for investing in research and development and financing climate-smart technologies especially in regions more vulnerable to cross-border climate impacts. This option would help Kenya to adapt to reducing climate finance and ODA coming from outside of the country.</li>
              <li>Although most adaptation options relevant to research were national, advocating for international knowledge sharing and technological collaborations were mentioned at the transnational level.</li>

            <td><ul>
              <li>Options relevant to public-private partnership were a mix of policy- and industry-based adaptation activities, suggesting that while private sectors need to get involved in adaptive capacity building for their own future benefits, policy makers are also required to make incentives for private sector participation by setting up policies supporting private sectors.</li>
              <li>Stakeholders recognized the importance of public-private partnership at both national and transnational levels for adaptation governance by touching upon the importance of private investments for financing adaptation research and development. Co-managing business activities in shared ecosystems was another role for private sector that would address the impact of decreasing economic activities in sectors such as tourism.</li>
