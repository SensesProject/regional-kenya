        <p>In this case study, we showed how co-production techniques could be used in a sub-global impact, adaptation, and vulnerability study. As Kenya was a knowledge-scarce context regarding socioeconomic scenarios, we designed a combined exploratory and normative process, developing socioeconomic scenarios at first and then using those to identify robust action items, and in both stages, we used co-production techniques to engage stakeholders and non-scientists. Results from this case study show that using co-production techniques is significantly important for developing locally relevant scenarios. We used a combined top-down and bottom-up approach to develop cross-scale scenarios linked to global socioeconomic context (SSP). Co-production techniques facilitated the bottom-up element of our approach and assisted in including stakeholder opinions on the most important future drivers at local and regional scales in the process.</p>
        <p>Co-production techniques were also useful in assessing future cross-border climate impacts and adaptation responses together with local and regional adaptation planners and policy makers. We engaged with stakeholders to assess the effectiveness of the current adaptation planning in Kenya to address future cross-border climate impacts. Stakeholders collectively indicated that the current adaptation landscape in Kenya makes almost no references to future cross-border climate impacts and identified new measures and adaptation actions that are necessary to address those impacts. Stakeholders suggested that the design and implementation of many adaptation actions addressing cross-border climate impacts would primarily require regional and global cooperation. Increasing awareness about climate impacts transmitting across borders, and the fact that adaptation to climate change in one country could reduce impacts and vulnerabilities in other countries could encourage stakeholders to initiate stronger collaborations on adaptation and develop collective actions.</p>
