      <p>In this case study, we develop and use a stakeholder-driven scenario framework to explore future cross-border climate impacts in Kenya and co-produce adaptation options to address those impacts. The framework comprises a set of stakeholder-generated sub-global scenarios linked to the global climate scenario architecture, especially the <a target="_blank" href="https://climatescenarios.org/primer/socioeconomic-development">Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs)</a>. Co-production techniques are used throughout the process for developing scenarios and using them for impact assessment and adaptation planning.</p>
