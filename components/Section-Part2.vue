      <p>In the next step of the scenario process, the research team created narratives for the extended SSPs. Visualizations were also created based on the short versions of narratives for the extended SSPs by a data visualization and graphic design group. We used intuitive logic [hyperlink to the co-production DB] to develop the narratives and presented both narratives and visualizations using scenario-axes technique (van â€™t Klooster & van Asselt, 2006).</p>
