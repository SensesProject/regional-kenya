          <h3>Assessing future cross-border climate risks and adaptation options for Kenya.</h3>
        </header>
        <p>In this case study, we develop and use a stakeholder-driven scenario framework to explore future cross-border climate impacts in Kenya and co-produce adaptation options to address those impacts. The framework comprises a set of stakeholder-generated sub-global scenarios linked to the global climate scenario architecture, especially the Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) [hyperlink to the primer].</p>

          <h2>Cross-scale scenarios (called Nested scenarios in the LM figure)</h2>
        </header>
        <p>To develop cross-scale scenarios, we link the development of local scenarios to the Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) [hyperlink to the primer]. We use a combined top-down and bottom-up approach (Nilsson et al., 2017) to develop Kenyan scenarios linked to the SSPs, where the top-down element is a set of four SSPs ,  and the bottom-up element includes stakeholder-generated local and regional knowledge concerning future vulnerability to cross-border climate impacts.</p>
        <p>Local scenarios for Kenya were developed through a co-production process implemented in a workshop series. The co-production process started with the bottom-up element where using brainstorming [hyperlink to the co-production DB] techniques, stakeholders generated information on the relevant socioeconomic drivers for understanding future vulnerabilities to cross-border climate risks. The time horizon was set to 2040-2060. Drivers were prioritized based on the level of importance (to the understanding of future cross-border climate impacts) and uncertainty, i.e. the extent to which the future development of a driver is unclear, vague, or least-predictable. The drivers that scored high on both importance and uncertainty were selected as the key drivers.</p>
        <p>Then, as the top-down element, the global SSPs were introduced into the process as ‘boundary conditions’ (context scenarios) for the future development of the key driving forces. The overarching question to guide the process was “How could driver x unfold at the local and regional level in the world described in SSP1,3,4, and 5?”. A variation of morphological analysis [hyperlink to the co-production DB] was used to identify plausible future states for the identified drivers. The combination of key drivers and their associated states given each SSP provide the skeleton for the local and regional extensions of the respective SSP.</p>

        </header>
        <p>Since the scenarios were constructed to inform adaptation planning to cross-border climate impacts, we also wanted them to include elements of links to outside Kenya. To this end we opted for illustrating such links with global climate impacts modelling outputs. We reviewed future drivers of importance at local and regional scale identified by stakeholders and selected food imports as a key future driver for running climate impact models.</p>
        <p>For the analysis here we used data generated within the ISIMIP [hyperlink to ISIMIP] project, more specifically within its second round ISIMIP2b (Frieler et al., 2017). The ISIMIP2b climate scenarios entail both RCP2.6 and RCP6.0 climates from four Earth system models (GFDL-ESM2M (Dunne et al., 2012), HadGEM2-ES (Collins et al., 2011), IPSL-CM5A-LR (Boucher et al., 2020) and MIROC5 (Watanabe et al., 2010) that were run in the context of the CMIP5 project (Taylor et al., 2012).  The crop model data employed here are from the three crop models GEPIC (Folberth et al., 2012; Izaurralde et al., 2006; J. Liu et al., 2007; The EPIC Crop Growth Model, n.d.),,  LPJmL (Bondeau et al., 2007) and PEPIC (W. Liu et al., 2016).</p>
        <p>Running crop models under low-end and medium/high end climate change (RCPs 2.6 [hyperlink to the primer, climate change page] linked to ESSP 1 and 4 and RCP6.0 [hyperlink to the primer, climate change page] linked to ESSP 3 and 5), we developed alternative projections of crop production in the countries exporting essential crops to Kenya  for two time-slices, 2035-2064 and 2070-2099.</p>

          <h2>Future cross-border climate impacts (called risk assessment in the LM figure)</h2>
        </header>
        <p>In the next step, we used the scenario set as an analytical tool to identify a set of future cross-border climate impacts for Kenya together with stakeholders. The process started with a conversation on the current adaptation strategy of Kenya and after the discussion, Brainstorming [hyperlink to the co-production techniques DB] techniques were used to identify the most important future cross-border climate impacts that are going to need adaptation within Kenya given the alternative future scenarios.</p>
        <p>The extended SSPs and four pathways through which climate impacts are transmitted across space (Hedlund et al., 2018) were used to structure our analysis frame for the brainstorming session. The guiding question was “What are the most important future cross-border climate impacts (for Kenya) in people, biophysical, trade and finance risk pathways given the extended SSP1,3,4 and 5?”. The time perspective was the same as the one governing the scenario development, i.e. 2040-2060.</p>
